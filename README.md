# Measurement and Analysis of Allelic Physical Distances

APDtools is a stand-alone pack of scripts originally designed as helper tools of the [GeneMates](https://github.com/wanyuac/GeneMates) package. APDtools implements the following functionality:

- Measurement of allelic physical distances (APDs) in genome assemblies; (`measurement`)
  - Measurement of APDs from complete genome assemblies; (`measurement/ref`)
- Accuracy analysis of shortest-path distances (SPDs) by comparing SPDs to true APDs obtained from complete genome assemblies; (`accuracy`)
- Establishment of relationships between APDs and other biological data for interpretation. (`biology`)

Please see README of each subdirectory for details.
