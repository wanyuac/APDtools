# Linking Allelic Physical Distances to other Biological Data

The only script in this directory, `dist2cluster.py`, measures the shortest physical distance between target alleles and a cluster of other alleles in each input genome assembly. It requires `Bandage (distance)` to measure the shortest-path distances between alleles. Use ```python dist2cluster.py --help``` to show options of this script.
